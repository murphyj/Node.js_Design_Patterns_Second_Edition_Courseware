# Parallel Execution - Email Movie Quotes

In this exercise, we have an number of different emails, the contents of which is stored in a variety of different files inside an `drafts` folder. 

Using the Unlimited Parallel Execution pattern we want to perform the following:

* Load the contents of each of the `drafts` from the files
* Send each of the emails with parallel execution
* Once we've read the contents of the email from the `drafts` folder and are ready to send it put the email in the `outbox`
* Once we have successfully sent the email we can then move it to the `sent` folder (removing it from the `outbox`).
* If there is a failure to send then the email stays in the `outbox` with the error written to the console.

## Mailgun

To simulate the benefits of parallel execution we are going to use a free email api called Mailgun (it provides up to 10,000 emails free every month so there's no risk of being charged for it).
